Grocery store project

In this project I used html, css, and jquery. Here are the main things that I've shown in my project

1. nav: flexbox, animation, responsiveness, pseudoelement to create animation, hamburger menu on mobile devices
3. header: slider animation using css animation
3. about: grid layout
4. Products, offer: flexbox layout
5. Using jquery: menu hamburger, go to section, creating elements and populating products and offer, changing menu position after scrolling
